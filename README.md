# dragonStack
Built upon my fullstack auth system, using Node, Express, React, Redux and a PostgreSQL DB.
This is my first steps towards a browserbased game using modern technologies.

This is still a work in progress..
Auth and security is done(ish), need to upgrade futher from SHA256, upgrade the salt and add a SSL Certicicate to really secure the cookie.
This "game" will never be finished, just adding alot of different features to learn and grasp the concepts.

Link to the game will be added soonTM.
